# marsh.tidb.ticat
A [ticat](https://github.com/innerr/ticat) mods repo: tidb tools (experimental)

## This doc is WIP

## Target
* Improve the experience and efficiency in non-production scenarios
    * TiDB developing, integration testing, benchmark, POC, etc
* More details: [why-ticat](./doc/why-ticat.md)

## How ticat can achieve that?
* Human friendly
    * Organize job flow with (shell) commands
    * All commands are highly compacted, support fuzzy input, hands on in no time
* Scenario-centered
    * Focus on get things done smoothly in a scenario
* Feature-rich
    * Large amount of modules
        * Components can be easily written in any language
        * ..or from any existing utility by wrapping it up
    * Components' interacting form high-level features
* Write once, run anywhere
    * Save or edit flow easily
    * Share modules and flows easily
* An example: [autotune + benchmark](./doc/usage-draft/benchmark.md)
* More details: [how-ticat-works](./doc/how-ticat-works.md)

```bash
ticat hub.add innerr/marsh.tidb.ticat
